This is a simple development of snake game to study purposes. The first step is to make the snake game only with built-in python libraries and use the terminal and visual interface. After that, the final step is to make the final version in pygame with OOP style.

E o objetivo final eh implementar isso com uma protoboard num painel de leds com base na matriz do game.
